# Face-Mask-Removal

The manuscript for this project can be viewed [here](https://github.com/Rohan-Jagannathan/Face-Mask-Removal/blob/master/FaceMaskRemoval.pdf)

The individual models for segmentation, inpainting, and super-resolution can be found in the face_mask_segmentation, face_inpainting, and face_booster directories, respectively

The full 3-model pipeline can be found in the FaceUnmasking.ipynb file, or [here](https://github.com/Rohan-Jagannathan/Face-Mask-Removal/blob/master/FaceUnmasking.ipynb)

The checkpoints, final_weights, and models directories contain saved weights for each model and cached versions of them
